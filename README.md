Files:
- index.html

How to deploy:
1. Upload these files to a GitHub repo (or directly to Render/Netlify).
2. If using Netlify: create site from Git, publish directory = root ('.').
3. In Settings (⚙) inside the app you can change the Backend API Endpoint and save it (stored in localStorage).
4. Default backend is https://smart-crypto-backend.onrender.com — change if you deployed elsewhere.
5. Add your OpenAI key in the backend environment variables on Render (OPENAI_API_KEY) for richer AI (optional).
